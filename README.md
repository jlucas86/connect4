# Connect4
## About Project
This project aimes to create an ai agent to play connect4 using the minimax algorithm. Due to the depth required to get to an end state with the minimax algorithm a heuristic as use to ensure the game can run on anycomputer. The heuristic was traind using the gentic algorithm. To do this the agent was first trained aginst the random agent with the goal of winning as fast a possible. Next, the agent was trained against a heuristic that proved to be decent at winning. Finally, the agent was trained against the former version of it's self.
### Built With
- Pyhton
- PyGAD
## Usage
## Future Updates
Adding alphabeta pruning is the next goal with this project, beacuse it may eliminate the need for a complicated heuristic.
